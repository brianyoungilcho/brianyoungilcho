# Hey, I'm Brian 👋

**2x technical founder** who turns research into revenue. I prototype with Claude, ship full-stack systems from scratch, and translate nascent ideas into category-defining products.

## What I'm Working On

🔊 **Senior PM at [Flock Safety](https://www.flocksafety.com/)** — Driving a 8-figure product turnaround, evolving a single-purpose gunshot detector into a scalable Acoustic Intelligence Platform.

🐕 **[Pupsday.com](https://pupsday.com)** — Solo-built dog subscription e-commerce platform. Custom quiz-driven personalization that Shopify couldn't support. Profitable at $1K+ MRR with 30% margins.

🤖 **[whynow.ai](https://whynow.ai)** — AI tools I'm building and experimenting with.

## Background

Before this, I co-founded two companies:

**Resonado Labs** (2016-2022) — Deep-tech audio R&D startup. Co-invented novel transducer architecture from first-principles physics research. Partnered with Hyundai, VOXX, and U.S. Army Special Operations. Exited to LCI Industries (NYSE: LCII).
- 🔬 5 U.S. utility patents
- 💰 $7M+ raised (Seed/Series A)
- 🏭 Full commercialization: HQ R&D → China factory integration → mass production

**Jobtest.org** (2022-2025) — B2C career marketplace. Built from zero to $5M ARR. Early LLM adopter — implemented vector-matching algorithms to ground GPT recommendations in real job data, reducing hallucinations and increasing LTV by 20%.

## How I Build

I ship fast by combining AI tools with product intuition:

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Claude (Opus/Sonnet) | Architecture decisions, code generation, debugging |
| Lovable | Rapid UI prototyping |
| Supabase | Backend, auth, real-time, edge functions |
| Cursor | AI-augmented development |

## Technical Interests

- **LLM Grounding** — Making AI outputs reliable by anchoring them in real data
- **Geospatial AI** — Current gap: LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning for city-scale deployments
- **Hardware-Software Integration** — Translating physics research into shippable products
- **0-to-1 Product Development** — Finding PMF in ambiguous spaces

## Writing & Thinking

I write about building products, AI prototyping patterns, and lessons from two exits:

- 📝 [Technical Writing](https://github.com/brianyoungilcho/technical-writing) — Essays on product, AI, and building companies
- 🛠️ [AI Prototyping Patterns](https://github.com/brianyoungilcho/ai-prototyping-patterns) — My workflow for shipping with Claude, Lovable, and Supabase
